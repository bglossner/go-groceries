Add a "Discard" and "Cancel" modal on top of the grocery list (in `GroceryList.tsx`) create/edit modal when users click off the create/edit modal that would normally close the modal. It should give the message "Are you sure you want to discard any changes?". Only show this new discard modal if there are changes to the form.

It should be implemented the same as it is in `Meals.tsx` for the discard feature there when editing/creating meals.
